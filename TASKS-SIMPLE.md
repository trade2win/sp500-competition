# Project Plan for Stock Market Prediction Contest Platform

## 1. Database Expansion

- Add more tables to the database to store user predictions, actual S&P 500 index data, and competition outcomes.
- Suggested Tables: `Predictions`, `SP500`, `Contests`, `ContestResults`.

## 2. Automated Data Fetching

- Implement an automated process to fetch the actual S&P 500 data from the API and store it in the `SP500` table.

## 3. User Interface Enhancements for Predictions

- Enhance the user interface to capture the necessary data for a prediction.
- This could include fields for predicted high, low, closing values, and the direction of change (up or down).
- Ensure these data points are saved in the `Predictions` table.

## 4. Contest Creation and Management

- Develop a system to create and manage contests.
- Features could include setting the start and end dates, determining scoring rules, and assigning contests to participants.
- Store these contests in the `Contests` table.

## 5. Scoring Algorithm

- Develop a scoring algorithm that calculates user scores based on contest rules.
- This involves comparing user predictions in the `Predictions` table with actual values in the `SP500` table.
- Store the results in the `ContestResults` table.

## 6. Results Display

- Develop an interface to display contest results.
- Features could include a leaderboard showing current standings and user profiles displaying past predictions and results.

## 7. System Testing

- Conduct rigorous testing to ensure all components work together correctly.
- Debug and refine the system as necessary.

## 8. Deployment

- Upon completion of testing, deploy the system for users to start participating in contests.
